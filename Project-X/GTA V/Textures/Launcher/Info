How to add new packs...

make a new file example : 
Themes.json
Use a structure like this :
[
{
  "Name": "Example Theme",
  "Image": "LinkToAnImage",
  "Downloads" : [
  {
  "Link" : "LinkToDownload",
  "Path" : "C:\\NWord" // this is what to do with the file in this case we would either move it to our themese folder or apply it to our settings
  //Additional Stuff if needed (Handle it correctly in the source code of the launcher)
  }
  ]
}
]
